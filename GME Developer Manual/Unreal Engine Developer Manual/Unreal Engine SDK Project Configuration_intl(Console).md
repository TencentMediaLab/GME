6. If you are using Unreal Engine v4.21 or higher, you need to add the following code after downloading the GME sample code for Unreal Engine:
```
AUEDemoLevelScriptActor::AUEDemoLevelScriptActor()
{
    PrimaryActorTick.bCanEverTick = true;
}
```

>Tick is disabled by default and must be enabled manually.
